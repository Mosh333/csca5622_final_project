    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the digital age, computer hardware is ubiquitous, and its performance continues to improve year by year. Intel's co-founder provided valuable insight into how computers would evolve, known as **Moore's Law** ([see Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)). This observation states that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles approximately every two years. The chart below illustrates the trend from 1970 to 2020:\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on Moore's Law, consumers might expect to get computer hardware with double the transistors every two years—leading to predictable and consistent increases in computing power. However, the reality is far more complex. As the number of transistors crammed into a fixed area increases, **quantum physics** begins to interfere, imposing physical limitations. These constraints prevent engineers from continuing to follow Moore's Law indefinitely. According to [nano.gov](https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/what/nano-size), the average size of a gold atom is 1/3 nm! Clearly, there is a limit to how many transistors can be packed into computer parts. Below are the trends in chip lithography size according to Wikipedia:\n",

    "According to Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, **Moore's Law is dead** ([TechSpot article](https://www.techspot.com/news/96094-nvidia-jensen-huang-once-again-claims-moore-law.html)). This statement seems reasonable given the physical limitations of current chip designs. As the rate of improvement in transistor count decreases year over year, will consumers start paying more for diminishing performance gains?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Should Consumers Care About the Death of Moore's Law?\n",
    "\n",
    "With the decline of Moore's Law, we can expect fewer improvements in transistor density in upcoming generations. This poses a concern for consumers, as we may start paying more for diminishing returns on performance. As traditional computing approaches its physical limits, incremental improvements will become smaller, potentially benefiting corporations more than consumers. This could lead to a scenario where consumers pay more for fewer benefits, which is undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Economic Reality Today\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation has steadily eroded purchasing power in the USA over the last 50 years. As inflation rises, the real cost of consumer goods, including technology, increases, affecting affordability. Here are links to inflation-related data:\n",

    "## Purpose of This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the trends in CPU and GPU parts over the past 20 years?\n",
    "2. Is the price-to-performance ratio of these parts keeping up? Are consumers getting a fair deal compared to 10 to 20 years ago?\n",
    "3. Can we predict the performance of next-gen, unreleased CPU and GPU parts using supervised machine learning models?\n"
